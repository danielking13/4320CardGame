# War Description

## Objective
The objective is to win all of the cards.

## Basics
A standard 52 deck of cards is used. Cards are shuffled. Cards are dealt out equally to each player until the deck is gone. So, in a two player game, each player has half of the deck; in a three player game, each player has a third of the deck, etc. Players do not look at the cards they have; their decks are face down and in a stack. Once the game begins, each player draws the card from the top of their deck and places it face up in the middle for everyone to see. The player with the "highest" card wins that round and takes all of the cards in the middle, places them face down at the bottom of their deck for re-use. The ranking order of cards is as follows: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. Eventually, one player ends up with all of the cards. 

## War
If player 1 draws a 5 and player 2 and player 3 both draw a Queen, then who gets the cards? If the highest card drawn happens to be a tie, you enter "war". After the 5 and two queens are drawn, player 2 and player 3 both pull three cards from the top of their deck and place them face down on the table as a sort of jackpot. On the count of 3, they draw the card from the top of their deck and place it face up as they do every round, and the person that has the higher card there gets to take the original 5 and two queens, but also all of the cards that are facing down, and the tie-breaker cards.
